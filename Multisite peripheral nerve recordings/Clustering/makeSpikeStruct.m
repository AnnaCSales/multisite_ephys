%Script takes output from phy and open ephys and produces a struct which contains
%clustered spike data, average waveforms, TTLs recorded in OEP.
%
%Updated July 2020 to automatically process and add TTL information from
%openephys in either binary or continuous format. 

%Dependencies:
% returnTTLs - script to process digital TTLs.
% KSdir (OEP utility)  - which in turn requires loadParamsPy, readNPY
% (npy-matlab-master), from PHY or OEP GIT.
% Amended versions of getWaveForms / getWaveForms_withBad (PHY/OEP utilities)
% Add the folder containing dependencies to the PATH
% addpath(genpath('D:\Code\MATLAB\AnalysingPHYoutput'));
% addpath(genpath('D:\Code\MATLAB\Packages\KS_PHY_OEP_utilities\preprocessing\'));
% Provide the name of directory with the data in it. This dir should contain the binary file
% used for clustering, the PHY output, at least one OEP continuous file if using 
% continuous format / a folder called TTL if using binary. OEP metadata
% (events, messages files etc) should be in there too.
rootpath=[pwd '\'];
% Provide the name of the binary file used for clustering.

% Provide the name of the folder where the TTL info is, if using binary
% (this field does not matter if you are using continuous format)
