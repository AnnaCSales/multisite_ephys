# Multisite_ephys
Code created during my PhD for processing electrophysiology data in MATLAB.
These scripts supported the data pipeline: 
  
  
openEphys (continuous format)  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &darr;  
MATLAB pre-processing  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &darr;  
MATLAB clustering with Kilosort   
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &darr;  
Cluster curation with PHY  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  &darr;  
Analysis in MATLAB  
  
## Dependencies
 - openEphys analysis tools from https://github.com/open-ephys/analysis-tools
 - Kilosort from https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort
 - PHY from https://github.com/cortex-lab/phy
 - PHY tools for converting Python output to MATLAB https://github.com/kwikteam/npy-matlab
 - A selection of bespoke utilites located in the 'Utilities' folder.

## Papers
These scripts were used for analysis / figure making used in the papers:  

- Sales AC, Newton GWT, Pickering AE, Dunham JP. Multisite silicon probes enable simultaneous recording of spontaneous and evoked activity in multiple isolated C-fibres in rat saphenous nerve. J Neurosci Methods. 2022 Feb 15;368:109419. doi: 10.1016/j.jneumeth.2021.109419. Epub 2021 Nov 17.


These files are mainly for use by members of the Pickering Lab at the University of Bristol, and are written primarily as 'starter' scripts to be adapted for future experiments (they are not ready-to-use software)
